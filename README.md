## Adding a new route entry point
1. **Make a new folder of what the page will be in the app folder**
2.	**Make a tsx file that's named "page.tsx" in the same folder that you created**
3.	**Add your content on there**
4.	**Whatever is the folder name will represent the link name**
ex: If i make a folder named "about-me" and I make a page.tsx in the "about-me" folder, the link that will show the content within the same folder will be localhost:3000/about-me
